# Bikun-O-Meter

## Overview
Our project aims to develop a web-based, battery-powered system for monitoring and analyzing crowd density at bus stops. Using ESP32CAM to capture images, the data is sent to a server to measure parameters such as headcount and stop area density. This system used a TensorFlow lite library running on Raspberry Pi for identifying headcount and bus at the bus stop. the process data is then uploaded to the Firebase Server and Real-time results are displayed on the website. 

The system offers a user-friendly web interface for accessing real-time data and includes a historical data storage feature for observing crowd trends over time. With innovative technology and battery energy, this flexible system can be deployed at various bus stop locations without relying on external power sources.
